Bug Description,Recommended Fix,Recommended Improvement
"Tab switching doesn't work: The switchTab function is referenced and exposed to window, but its definition is missing or incomplete in the code. This could cause undefined function errors when onclick handlers are triggered.",Define the full switchTab function if missing. Example: function switchTab(tabId) { document.querySelectorAll('.tab-content').forEach(el => el.classList.remove('active')); document.getElementById(tabId).classList.add('active'); document.querySelectorAll('.bottom-nav-item').forEach(el => el.classList.remove('active')); document.getElementById('bottomNav-' + tabId)?.classList.add('active'); } Ensure all tab elements exist in HTML.,"Use a more robust tab system with event delegation and ARIA attributes for accessibility. Add smooth transitions (e.g., fade-in) using CSS animations for better UX."
"Saves don't work: In saveMetrics(), data is collected but if clinical alerts are triggered, saving is pending until acknowledgeAlert() is called. If users don't acknowledge, data isn't saved. Also, no feedback if storage quota is exceeded despite try-catch.","In saveMetrics(), ensure that if no alerts, save immediately. In alert modal, make ""Acknowledge and Save"" button call acknowledgeAlert(). Add a fallback to in-memory storage if localStorage fails, and notify user.","Implement auto-save with debounce on input changes (e.g., every 5s). Add IndexedDB as a fallback for larger data sets to handle quota issues. Include versioned backups (e.g., save to 'cardiacRecoveryData_v2') for data recovery."
"Photo thumbnail on header doesn't work: displayUserPhoto() sets backgroundImage on #userPhoto, but if the element doesn't exist or CSS conflicts (e.g., no height/width set), it won't display. Also, no error handling for invalid data URLs.","Add checks: if (photoElement && photoData && photoData.startsWith('data:image/')) { ... } else { console.warn('Invalid photo data or element missing'); } Ensure HTML has <div id=""userPhoto"" style=""width:40px;height:40px;border-radius:50%;""></div>.","Add photo cropping/resizing using Canvas API before saving to localStorage to optimize size (e.g., limit to 100KB). Support drag-and-drop upload and preview modal for better usability. Integrate with device camera for direct capture."
"Truncated code in document: The provided code is truncated at around 152726 characters, potentially missing key sections like full Bluetooth handling or chart updates, leading to incomplete functionality.","Concatenate and verify the full 6000+ lines in the actual file. Use linter (e.g., ESLint) to detect syntax errors from truncation.","Split the large JS file into modular files (e.g., core.js, ui.js, data.js, devices.js) and use import/export or a bundler like Webpack for better maintainability and faster loading."
"localStorage errors not fully handled: Try-catch exists for load/save, but if storageAvailable=false, UI doesn't disable save buttons or provide alternatives, potentially leading to lost data.","In init(), if !storageAvailable, disable save buttons and show a persistent banner: ""Temporary mode: Data won't persist after refresh."" Use in-memory fallback for allData.","Migrate to IndexedDB for unlimited storage. Add export/import JSON buttons for manual backups. Implement cloud sync (e.g., via Firebase) with user consent for cross-device persistence."
"CRPS calculation uses defaults if demographics not set: calculateCRPS() warns in console but doesn't prompt user, leading to inaccurate scores without notice.","In updateCRPSDisplay(), if crpsResult.usingDefaults, add a warning badge: <span class=""warning"">Using defaults - Update demographics in Settings</span>. Auto-open settings if no demographics on first load.","Make demographics required with a setup wizard on first app use. Add real-time CRPS preview in data entry form as user inputs metrics. Integrate with health APIs (e.g., Google Fit) for auto-filling demographics."
"Swipe gestures conflict: initSwipeGestures() on .container may interfere with other touch events (e.g., scrolling), especially if verticalDistance threshold is too high.",Adjust maxVerticalDistance to 50px and add e.preventDefault() only if swipe detected. Test on multiple devices.,"Use a gesture library like Hammer.js for robust swipe detection. Add visual feedback (e.g., arrow indicators) during swipe for better UX."
"Chart initialization issues: initializeCRPSTrendChart() assumes #crpsTrendChart exists; if tab not loaded, it warns but doesn't retry, potentially missing updates.",Wrap in try-catch and add a mutation observer to re-init if canvas appears later (lazy-loaded tabs). Call on tab switch.,"Use Chart.js plugins for auto-resizing and themes (dark/light mode). Add export to PNG/PDF buttons. Optimize data points to prevent lag with large datasets (e.g., downsample old data)."
"Validation not preventing save: validateMetricInput() shows warnings but saveMetrics() proceeds even with errors, potentially saving invalid data.","In saveMetrics(), loop through fields: if any validateMetricInput(field, value).valid === false, collect errors and showNotification with list, return without saving.",Add form-level validation with HTML5 required/min/max. Use a library like Yup for schema validation. Highlight all invalid fields on save attempt.
Bluetooth connection lacks permissions check: connectPolarH10() assumes Web Bluetooth available; no fallback if denied.,"Before requestDevice, check if (navigator.bluetooth) else show ""Browser not supported"". Handle Permission Denied error specifically.",Add device scanning animation. Support multiple devices with a list view. Add auto-reconnect on page load if previously connected.
"HR monitoring no data persistence on error: stopHRMonitoring() saves to localStorage but if error in stopNotifications, session might not save.","Move saveHRSession() before stopNotifications, and wrap in try-catch to always attempt save.","Add real-time syncing to allData during monitoring (e.g., every 30s). Visualize sessions in a dedicated history tab with charts."
"No error boundaries: Global errors (e.g., undefined variables) crash the app without recovery.","Add window.onerror handler: window.onerror = (msg, url, line) => { showNotification('Error: ' + msg, 'error'); console.error(msg, url, line); return true; }",Use React or Vue for component-based error boundaries. Add Sentry or similar for error tracking. Implement app versioning with changelog.
"Performance with large data: allData as object grows; recalculateAllCRPS() loops all keys, slow for 6000+ entries.","Limit history to 365 days, archive old data. Use Web Workers for heavy computations like recalculateAllCRPS().","Optimize with memoization (e.g., _.memoize for calculateCRPS). Add pagination to history table. Use BigInt for precise calculations if needed."
"PWA install prompt timing: Shows after 3s, but if dismissed, waits 7 days; no re-prompt logic based on usage.","Check usage (e.g., if >3 sessions, re-prompt after dismissal period).","Add benefits modal: ""Install for offline access and faster loading."" Track install analytics."
"Theme toggle not persisting across reloads: Saved to localStorage, but applied only on DOMContentLoaded; might flicker.",Apply theme class immediately on load via script before HTML parse: <script>if(localStorage.theme==='light') document.documentElement.classList.add('light-mode');</script>,"Support system preference: window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: light)').addEventListener('change', ...) for auto-toggle."
"No accessibility features: Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation for tabs/swipes.","Add role=""tab"" to nav items, aria-selected. Make swipe areas focusable with keyboard equivalents (e.g., arrow keys for date nav).",Run Lighthouse audit and fix issues. Add high-contrast mode. Support screen readers with live regions for notifications.
"Code duplication: Similar try-catch for localStorage in multiple places (e.g., savePatientName, setRecoveryDay1).","Create a util: function safeLocalSet(key, value) { try { localStorage.setItem(key, value); } catch(e) { showNotification('Storage error', 'error'); } }","Refactor to modules: dataUtils.js for storage, uiUtils.js for notifications. Use TypeScript for type safety."
"Missing null checks: e.g., in updateCRPSDisplay(), assumes crpsResult exists; could throw if null.",Add guards: if (!crpsResult) return; at function start.,Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) throughout. Add PropTypes or JSDoc for function params.
"Date handling inconsistencies: currentDate uses new Date(), but comparisons ignore timezones.","Use luxon or moment.js for consistent date handling: e.g., DateTime.fromISO(dateStr).diffNow('days').",Standardize all dates to UTC. Add date picker validation to prevent future dates in historical mode.
"No unit tests: Code lacks tests, making bugs harder to catch.",Add Jest setup and test key functions like calculateCRPS() with various inputs.,Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions for auto-testing on changes. Cover 80%+ code with unit/integration tests.
Mobile nav overflow: bottomNav with 10 items may crowd on small screens.,"Limit to 5 key tabs, move others to a ""More"" menu with dropdown.","Use adaptive layout: horizontal scroll for nav on narrow screens. Add badges (e.g., alert count) on icons."
GPS integration incomplete: captureLocation() uses window.getLocationLabel() which is undefined in code.,"Define getLocationLabel(): async function getLocationLabel() { return new Promise((res, rej) => navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(pos => { const label = 'Location captured'; res({coords: pos.coords, label, googleMapsUrl: https://maps.google.com/?q=${pos.coords.latitude},${pos.coords.longitude}`}); }, rej)); }` window.getLocationLabel = getLocationLabel;","Add reverse geocoding via API (e.g., Google Maps API) for human-readable address. Store location with entries and show on map in analytics. Handle offline with last-known position."
Population comparison undefined: updatePopulationComparison() called but not defined.,Define stub: function updatePopulationComparison() { console.log('Population comparison update'); } or remove calls if feature incomplete.,"Integrate real data from APIs (e.g., WHO stats) for benchmarks. Visualize with charts comparing user to averages."
"Service Worker cache incomplete: Caches only './' and Chart.js; misses CSS, images, other JS.","Add all assets to urlsToCache: e.g., 'styles.css', 'images/*'. Use Workbox for advanced caching.","Implement precaching with manifest. Add offline page fallback. Notify user of updates with ""New version available"" prompt."
