# Google Play Store Setup Guide - Trusted Web Activity (TWA)

## Overview
This guide will help you publish **Cardiac Recovery Pro** to the Google Play Store using a Trusted Web Activity (TWA) wrapper.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Android Studio installed
- [ ] Google Play Console developer account ($25 one-time fee)
- [ ] Deployed web app (vercel.app or custom domain)
- [ ] Java JDK 8 or higher
- [ ] Node.js and npm installed

---

## Step 1: Update manifest.json

Your `public/manifest.json` is already configured with:
- ‚úÖ App name: "Cardiac Recovery Pro"
- ‚úÖ Short name: "Cardiac Pro"
- ‚úÖ Icons: 192x192 and 512x512
- ‚úÖ Display mode: standalone
- ‚úÖ Start URL: /

**Action Required:** Update `icons` paths if icons are in a different location.

---

## Step 2: Generate TWA App using Bubblewrap

### Install Bubblewrap CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @bubblewrap/cli
```

### Initialize TWA project:
```bash
bubblewrap init --manifest=https://cardiac-recovery-pro.vercel.app/manifest.json
```

Follow the prompts:
- **Domain:** cardiac-recovery-pro.vercel.app
- **Package name:** com.cardiacrecoverypro.app
- **App name:** Cardiac Recovery Pro
- **Display mode:** standalone
- **Default icon:** Use 512x512 icon
- **Fallback behavior:** Use webapp
- **Enable notifications:** Yes (for future features)

### Build the APK:
```bash
bubblewrap build
```

This generates:
- `app-release-unsigned.apk` (for testing)
- `app-release-signed.aab` (for Play Store)

---

## Step 3: Set Up Digital Asset Links

Create `.well-known/assetlinks.json` on your domain:

```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.cardiacrecoverypro.app",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        "YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT_HERE"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

**To get your SHA256 fingerprint:**
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore android.keystore -alias android -storepass YOUR_PASSWORD -keypass YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Copy the SHA256 value and paste it into assetlinks.json.

**Deploy to Vercel:**
Create `public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` with the content above.

---

## Step 4: Test the TWA Locally

### Install on Android device:
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk
```

### Test Asset Links:
Open this URL in Chrome on Android:
```
https://digitalassetlinks.googleapis.com/v1/statements:list?source.web.site=https://cardiac-recovery-pro.vercel.app&relation=delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls
```

Should return your app's package name.
